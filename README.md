# Breast_Cancer_Classification
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, accounting for 25% of all cancer cases and affected 2.1 Million people in 2015, early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival.
The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign machine learning techniques can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis. Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancers with 79% accuracy, while 91% correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.
Our task is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features of patients from several cell images which are the respective Independant Features such as :-

       - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
